# Addendum - Usage of LLMs
---

LLMs were used sparingly in this project, and never for critical code sections.<br/>

**All documentation, comments and the entirety of the project report were written by me, using my own words and explaining my thought process.**<br/>
*Important: em dashes and en dashes were used in the project report. They are used correctly as it is adding relevant and related information. It is not a result of AI-generated text.*<br/>

The code was written mostly via experience and research on various websites and papers, including:
- [Stanley & Miikkulainen (2002) - Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)
- [Gershenson (2003) - Artificial Neural Networks for Beginners](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0308031)

- Various [Google Developers Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning) articles.
- Various [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles.

The [Claude](https://claude.ai/) LLM was used:
- For discussion and clarification regarding specific theoretical aspects of neuroevolution, genetic algorithms, and NEAT;
- For discussion regarding the larger-scale organisation of the project;
- For help with strict typing and type conversions;
- To speed up the Pygame learning process, as it was my first time using it;
- To troubleshoot specific code sections when they didn't produce the expected result;
- To help code the plotting process;
- To produce long, repetitive code, such as debug logging;
- To discuss the optimisation and multiprocess aspect of the project.

In summary, the LLM was used as (1) a learning tool to better understand the theory behind the classifiers, and (2) a tool to streamline troubleshooting and trivial aspects of the code. It was not used as a replacement for critical thinking and execution of the work.
